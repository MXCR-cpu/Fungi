#  (working name) Fungi

- A simple, concise webapp made to contextualize the effort of saving energy and the environment for the everyday consumer.

# Purpose

- The fungi webapp calculator is designed and implemented for the sole purpose of meeting the 2024 ACM October Hackathon challenge theme of `Building a Better and Sustainable Tomorrow`. It aims to create a small experience that contextualizes the average user's conservation effort that promotes further conservation and drives forward a cleaner brighter future.

# Objectives

## Must Have:

### Access to Relevent Energy Calculations:

- Prioritize Energy calculations because it is easy to design an experience around stationary locations
    - Follow this with water usage and convert it to energy usage (Watts) based on local water plant energy usage and service capacity
- If there is time, expand the webapp to include CO2 calculations
    - Include Bus, Biking, Walking, Car usage
- Focus on weekly and monthly calculations


### Basic Web Interface:

- Allow users to enter data and preform calculation.
- Due to time, this will be a frontend app with all calculation done on the user device
- The webapp will be hosted on vercel with their free tier.

## Should Have:

### UI Design:

- The calculator has to be clean and intuitive to use with a green/material theme.
- The calculator should be mobile friendly though this can be sacrificed if not capable of being acheived.

### Salient Comparisons:

- Provide salient factoids
    - example: "based upon the amount of carbon you saved over time, X people are Y percent less likely to develop lung related diseases"
    - example: "based upon the amount of water you saved over time, the local bill will cost X less than it would have otherwise"

## Could Have:

### Communial Statistics

- It would be nice to be able to demonstrate how one comparies in their neighborhood/city (more local, more relevent) or along the routes they take
    - Implementing a google maps view would be required here

### Local Ecological Impact

- Saving resources helps the environment by reducing the strain. Demonstrate this fact by sharing information that identifies species of interest that would benefit from a conservation effort and ties your effort into it.

## Won't Have:

### User Interaction with AI:

- The webapp will not request user interaction other than a request to perform a calculation

### User Feedback Survey:

- Implement a non-mandatory survey to gather user feedback after using the website. This will help in understanding user satisfaction and identifying areas for improvement.
